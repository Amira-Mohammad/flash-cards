# FlashCards Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React react native course. The goal of this project is to practise on topics that are included in the previous module such as
├── react native
├── react native with redux
├── React native routing " tabs and stack"

And I used some of packages that are compatable with React native to acheive this project such as
├── redux
├── react-redux
├── react navigation
├── expo

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo start`

then a web page of expo server will be run in the browser click on 'Run on Android device/emulator' after make sure that emulator is running
